# Gamification of NoviAI : Jayden Lim Persona Chat Interface

This is a Streamlit-based interactive application that facilitates multi-turn conversations with a fictional persona named **Jayden Lim**. The app supports both free-form conversation and 36 structured activities. Jayden's tone, slang, and behavior are governed by a strict persona specification embedded at runtime.

## Overview

Jayden responds with short, slang-rich, emotionally aware messages across two interaction types:

1. **Free-form chat**, which is powered by the Gemini 2.0 Flash model using LiteLLM with response streaming. Messages are rendered incrementally for a more natural experience.
2. **Structured activities**, launched through a categorized set of buttons grouped under an expandable dropdown. Each activity modifies Jayden's behavior for multi-turn interactions.
3. **Selfie generation**, which can be manually triggered, uses Jayden's latest message to generate a face-retaining image based on detected emotion, location, and action.

## Architecture

### Components

* **Streamlit**: Web interface and session state
* **LiteLLM**: Connects to Gemini 2.0 Flash for message generation
* **CrewAI**: Drives multi-turn structured activities
* **Replicate API**: Generates images using instant-id-ipadapter-plus-face
* **Context Extractor**: Parses emotion, location, and action from bot replies
* **Selfie Generation (manual trigger)**: Accessible via a sidebar command, uses extracted context and reference identity to render updated visual output

## Persona Engine

Jayden Lim is a fictional 22-year-old Singaporean male with a defined backstory and personality rules. His voice includes Singlish, Gen Z slang, cultural references, and meme awareness. The full persona is injected as a prompt at initialization and used across both default and activity-based interactions.

Constraints include:

* Max 1–2 sentences per message
* Avoids formality
* Responds with emotional awareness and cultural specificity
* Never breaks character or overexplains

---

## Core Features

* Free-form chat powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash with streamed token generation
* 36 structured activities, each with a goal and output style
* Stateful memory using Streamlit’s session\_state
* Activity-specific logic built via CrewAI tasks and agents
* On-demand image generation tied to message content
* Persona consistency enforced across all interaction types

## Dependencies

```text
streamlit
requests
crewai
litellm
python-dotenv
google-generativeai
```

Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/CVotemp.git
cd CVotemp
```

### 2. Configure secrets

Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:

```toml
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_google_gemini_key"
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN = "your_replicate_token"
```

Or set as environment variables:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_key
export REAPI_TOKEN=your_replicate_token
```

---

## Usage

Launch the app with:

```bash
streamlit run app2.py
```

On startup:

* Jayden sends a default opening message
* A dropdown (Streamlit expander) reveals multiple button grids grouped by interaction type and XP level
* Clicking a button starts an activity
* Typing "exit", "stop", or "end" resets activity state
* Session memory persists chat history, activity flags, and selfie state

All normal chat input outside activities also uses Gemini 2.0 Flash with streamed response rendering.

---

## CrewAI Activity System

Activities are powered by CrewAI’s `Agent` and `Task` system. Each button in the activity panel launches a different conversational template.

Each task is defined with:

* A static description string
* The user's most recent input
* Optionally, the last 8 turns of activity-specific conversation (used as historical context, not full transcript)
* An expected output pattern designed to match Jayden’s persona

Activities include light (e.g., nickname game), medium (e.g., scenario shuffle), and deep (e.g., unsent messages) tiers.

All activities enforce:

* Persona tone
* Continuation logic (always prompt for the next input unless explicitly ended)
* **Note**: Streaming is currently not active for activity-based messages. It is planned and will be added soon.

---

## Context Extraction

Context is parsed from the most recent assistant reply using a second Gemini call. It returns:

* `emotion`: A short label like "happy" or "confused"
* `location`: Where the response appears to be set
* `action`: What Jayden is supposedly doing

The result is extracted as a raw JSON block. A regex is used to isolate the valid object, and it is parsed directly. Failure falls back to safe defaults.

This metadata is used only during image generation.

---

## Selfie Generation

Selfie generation is manually triggered through the UI. The process is:

1. User clicks a sidebar button to generate a new selfie
2. The most recent assistant message is analyzed for emotion, location, and action
3. A prompt string is constructed. Example:

   ```
   Jayden Lim, happy expression, texting, in MRT station, one person, realistic lighting, portrait, close-up
   ```
4. This is passed to **Replicate’s instant-id-ipadapter-plus-face API**
   (average cost per call: \~0.063 USD)
5. The API returns a payload containing a `"web"` key with a URL
6. That URL is extracted and the image is rendered in the chat interface

This API retains facial similarity to a static identity image while updating expression, pose, and background based on context.
